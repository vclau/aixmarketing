# AIxMarketing by Humanic — Claude Code Workspace

This repository is an **open-source teaching lab** for agentic lifecycle marketing built on Claude Code. It contains slash commands and multi-step skills that generate, preview, and deploy marketing content — grounded in brand voice and real-world examples.

Maintained by [Humanic](https://humanic.ai).

## Repo Purpose
Show practitioners how to use Claude Code skills for end-to-end lifecycle marketing — from brand brief generation through email campaigns, ads, content, and direct integration with Humanic for sending.

## How the Orchestrators Work

### Copy Orchestrator (sequential chain)
```
[Brief] → copy-strategist → copy-writer → copy-qa-gate → copy-product-expert
                                                                    ↓
                                              [optional] copy-advertiser-lens
                                                                    ↓
                                              [optional] copy-humanizer
                                                                    ↓
                                                              [Final Copy]
```
Each stage's output feeds the next. The QA gate auto-fixes issues. Optional stages run when needed.

### SFMC Orchestrator (intent router)
```
[User Request] → esp-sfmc-orchestrator
                        ↓
            ┌───────────┼───────────────────┐
            ↓           ↓                   ↓
    ampscript-expert  sql-generator  journey-manager  ...
```
Classifies the request and routes to the correct SFMC sub-skill. Chains sub-skills when a task spans multiple areas.

## Conventions

### Prompt Structure
Every slash command follows this structure:
```
## Role / Context
## Task
## Format
## Constraints
## Example Input → Output  (for few-shot files)
```

### Brand Context
Always start a session by running `/brand-brief`. All downstream commands and skills assume brand context is loaded.

### Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` → `.env` and fill in API keys before running any demo script.

### MCP Integrations
The repo supports MCP servers for direct tool integration:
- **Humanic** — lifecycle email campaigns, cohorts, analytics
- **Figma** — design file access for email/ad creative briefs

Configure MCP servers in `.mcp.json` (excluded from git — see README for setup).

## Teaching Flow
1. Start with `/brand-brief` — set the brand context
2. Run the copy pipeline — `write email copy` triggers copy-orchestrator
3. Preview it — `preview my email` triggers email-preview
4. Push to Humanic — `list my campaigns` / `create a campaign`
5. QA before send — `launch checklist` triggers qa-email-production-process
6. Audit performance — `audit this journey` triggers perf-journey-auditor

## Key Principles
- **Brand brief first** — always ground outputs in brand voice before generating content
- **Skills fetch live data** — they pull real examples before writing, not just prompting from memory
- **Orchestrators chain skills** — never skip strategy or QA, the pipeline ensures quality
- **Show the chain** — for multi-step skills, show each step's reasoning, not just final output
- **Iterate, don't regenerate** — use Claude's context to refine, not restart
